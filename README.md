# Quartet Desk

A native SwiftUI macOS app that runs every query past a **quartet** — a panel of
4 LLMs queried in parallel — then has an anchor model synthesize one answer with
**dissent surfaced explicitly**. It applies the multi-model judge-panel
philosophy (used as a PR quality gate elsewhere) to general questions:
"write me a marketing plan", "review this contract clause", "plan this launch".

The core bet: one model's answer hides its blind spots; four models' answers
*disagree* at exactly the points you should be thinking hardest about. Quartet
Desk makes that disagreement a first-class output — a run without a parseable
dissent record shows a **"dissent extraction failed"** banner rather than
pretending consensus.

## Status: v1

Engine, providers, UI, export, and history are implemented and unit-tested
(engine with fakes/canned frames, the transport with canned HTTP responses,
the app model's run lifecycle with injected resolvers). Live end-to-end runs
(all 4 seats + synthesis + dissent) have been verified against the real APIs —
you still need to add your own API keys in Settings first.

Streaming calls retry transient failures (429/5xx/529, pre-data truncation)
with bounded, jittered backoff — never after the first received byte, so a
partial answer is never duplicated — and every provider call runs under a
per-call wall-clock timeout so a wedged stream can't hang a run. Answers cut
off at the model's token limit are kept but explicitly flagged as INCOMPLETE
(per-seat banner, synthesis-prompt note, export note) rather than passed off
as whole.

## Branding

Quartet Desk is published by **Affirmi Inc.** The `tv.affirmi` reverse-DNS
namespace (bundle id, Keychain service, `os.Logger` subsystem) is the
publisher's own domain and is intentional — it carries no infrastructure
coupling (no hosts, project refs, or secrets).

## What it does

1. **Seats** — 4 configurable panelists (provider + model id). Defaults:
   | Seat | Provider | Model |
   |---|---|---|
   | 1 (anchor) | Anthropic (direct) | `claude-opus-4-8` |
   | 2 | OpenRouter | `openai/gpt-5.6-sol-pro` |
   | 3 | OpenRouter | `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` |
   | 4 | OpenRouter | `qwen/qwen3.7-max` |
2. **Run pipeline** — the same prompt fans out to all 4 seats in parallel
   (streamed live into per-seat panes). The anchor then receives all answers and
   produces (a) one synthesized answer and (b) a structured dissent list
   (`{"dissents":[{topic, who, position}]}`) behind a `===DISSENT===` marker.
   Optional **Deliberate** toggle (off by default) adds a round 2 where each
   seat sees the others' answers and revises before synthesis.
3. **Result tabs** — ANSWER (synthesized, rendered markdown), PANEL (4 cards
   with each seat's full answer + usage + per-seat cost), DISSENT (disagreement
   list, or the fail-closed banner).
4. **Cost** — computed from provider-reported usage × an editable price table.
   Models without a configured price show **"price not set"** — the app never
   invents a number. Bundled prices: `claude-opus-4-8` $5/$25, `gpt-5.6-sol-pro`
   $5/$30, `gpt-5.6-terra` $2.5/$15, `gpt-5.6-luna` $1/$6 per MTok. Gemini/Qwen
   prices are intentionally unbundled — set them in Settings → Prices.
5. **Images** — drag-drop / paste / file-pick images into the composer; they're
   downscaled to ≤2048px long side and re-encoded as JPEG ≤4MB, then sent to all
   seats as multimodal content blocks.
6. **Export** — ANSWER or the full run to `.md` (toolbar → Export). PDF export
   is a stubbed, disabled menu item (see TODO in `RootView.swift`).
7. **History** — every run persists as JSON under
   `~/Library/Application Support/QuartetDesk/runs/`; sidebar lists past runs.
8. **Keys** — stored in the macOS Keychain (`kSecClassGenericPassword`, service
   `tv.affirmi.quartetdesk`), one item per provider. Settings has a **Test**
   button per key making a cheap live call (models list / key introspection).

## Architecture

```
App/                          @main shell (xcodegen app target)
Sources/
  QuartetEngine/              UI-free, network-free core  ← unit tested
    Models.swift              Seat, ChatMessage, ImageAttachment, TokenUsage
    StreamTypes.swift         StreamChunk, ProviderStreaming, ProviderResolving
    SSE/                      SSELineSplitter → SSEParser → per-provider decoders
    Prompt/PromptAssembly     panelist / synthesis / deliberation prompts
    Dissent/DissentParser     fail-closed ===DISSENT=== + JSON extraction
    Pricing/PriceTable        price lookup + CostCalculator
    Run/QuartetOrchestrator   fan-out → deliberate → synthesize → record
  QuartetProviders/           URLSession streaming clients + Keychain + KeyTester
    AnthropicClient           Messages API (x-api-key, anthropic-version, SSE events)
    OpenAIChatClient          OpenAI + OpenRouter (Bearer, chat/completions SSE)
  QuartetExport/              MarkdownExporter + RunHistoryStore
  QuartetUI/                  SwiftUI views + @Observable AppModel + ImagePipeline
Tests/
  QuartetEngineTests/         SSE, decoders, dissent, prices, prompts, orchestrator,
                              retry policy, timeout, truncation
  QuartetProvidersTests/      shared SSE transport vs canned HTTP (retry, envelopes)
  QuartetUITests/             AppModel run lifecycle (Stop, usage math, attachments)
```

Key boundaries:
- **The engine never touches the network or AppKit.** Providers implement
  `ProviderStreaming`; the orchestrator is tested end-to-end with fakes.
- **Fail closed everywhere.** SSE decoders require an explicit terminal frame
  (`message_stop` / `[DONE]`); a stream that ends without one throws
  `truncatedStream` and the seat is marked failed — a half answer is never shown
  as complete. Dissent JSON that doesn't parse → banner, not silent consensus.
- **No silent failures.** Every network call checks HTTP status (error body
  captured), every catch logs via `os.Logger` (subsystem
  `tv.affirmi.quartetdesk`), and errors surface in the UI.

## Build

```bash
# Libraries + engine tests (headless)
swift build
swift test

# The actual .app (requires xcodegen: brew install xcodegen)
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project QuartetDesk.xcodeproj -scheme QuartetDesk -configuration Debug build
# or: open QuartetDesk.xcodeproj and hit Run
```

First run: open Settings (Cmd+,) → API Keys, paste keys for Anthropic and/or
OpenRouter (the defaults need those two), hit **Test** on each, then run a query.

## Adding a seat model or a provider

- **New model on an existing provider**: Settings → Seats, edit the model id.
  Optionally add its price in Settings → Prices.
- **New provider**:
  1. Add a case to `ProviderKind` (`QuartetEngine/Models.swift`).
  2. If it speaks OpenAI chat-completions, add a `Flavor` to
     `OpenAIChatClient`; otherwise write a client conforming to
     `ProviderStreaming` (+ an SSE decoder in the engine so it's testable with
     canned frames — see `AnthropicSSEDecoder` for the pattern).
  3. Wire it in `KeychainProviderResolver.client(for:)` and add a Test call in
     `KeyTester`.
  4. The Settings key UI picks up the new `ProviderKind` case automatically.

## Known gaps (v1)

- Markdown rendering is modest (paragraph + fenced-code blocks, inline styles);
  headers/lists/tables render as plain-ish text.
- Synthesis and deliberation requests resend text only; images go to round-1
  panelist calls (and deliberation), not the synthesis call.
- Image attachments aren't persisted into history (only the count).
- PDF export is stubbed disabled.
- No notarization / Developer ID signing yet (ad-hoc signed, hardened runtime
  enabled). App icon is generated by `swift scripts/generate-appicon.swift`
  into the committed `App/Assets.xcassets`.
